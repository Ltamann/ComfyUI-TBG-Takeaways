# ComfyUI-TBG-Takeaways
# TGB‚Äôs ComfyUI Development Takeaways

A curated set of reusable ComfyUI nodes created by TGB, these sidecodes capture major advances in model sampling, noise scheduling, and image refinement to enhance stable diffusion workflows. All nodes in this pack are extracted from micro-developments created during the development of TBG ETUR. They‚Äôve been turned into standalone ‚Äúmicro nodes‚Äù for testing purposes and for anyone who enjoys experimenting with them.

## Included Nodes
- **VAE Decode ColorFix** *(New!)*  
  VAE Decode (ColorFix) - Fast, Color-Accurate Decoding for Flux Models
Solves the brightness shift and washed-out color problem that affects Flux models 
when using the standard VAE Decode node.
WHY THIS NODE?
Standard VAE Decode produces washed-out, brightened images with Flux models because 
it processes the entire image at once, causing normalization drift in the VAE decoder. 
This node uses tiled processing to maintain accurate colors while offering speed 
optimizations not available in the standard VAE Decode (Tiled) node.
HOW IT WORKS
The node breaks your image into smaller tiles during decode. Smaller tiles keep the 
VAE's normalization statistics closer to training values, preventing color shift. 
By default, it uses a single-pass approach (3x faster than standard tiled decode) 
while maintaining color accuracy.

- **PromptBatchGenerator** *(New!)*  
  Ever get super frustrated with those 81-frame batch videos where the same prompt just keeps repeating over and over? üò´ I know I did! Like, every 81 frames I‚Äôd have to smile or move my hands exactly the same way because the prompts were crazy repetitive. No no, that‚Äôs not fun for me.
But here‚Äôs a cool trick: did you know you can enter as many prompts as you like, separated by |, and the node will automatically calculate the time per prompt? That means you can actually tell a story! üéâ
Still, I wanted more‚Ä¶ so I asked my team to build a nicer random prompt generator. Now you can:
Input multiple prompts with different behavior strengths
Mix them all across your video
Let the node decide how the behaviors combine, so it feels natural and dynamic

- **TBG_FluxKontextStabilizer** 
  Developed specifically for the **TBG ETUR** (Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner), this node maintains exact positioning of reference images in final outputs. It stabilizes spatial context during tiled upscaling and refinement to ensure high-fidelity alignment and image coherence. Stay with euler beta and between 16 and 30 steps. Add to Promt: Repair and enhance this this this photo.

- **ModelSamplingFluxGradual**  
  Implements gradual flux-based sampling control for smoother transitions during model sampling - ModelSamplingFluxGradual interpolates between ModelSamplingFlux and ModelSamplingFlux Normalized. This allows for the best of both approaches.

- **PolyExponentialSigmaAdder  Highres Fix Flux**  
  The PolyExponential Sigma Adder¬†node¬†adds¬†the ability to manipulate curve parameters, such as adjusting the curve‚Äôs rigidity, and allows for the application of a negative poly-exponential curve¬†to the Sigmas.
The PolyExponential Sigma Adder¬†introduces a resolution-independent curve, ensuring a consistent adjustment to img2img¬†processing across different resolutions. Sustituci√≥n for resolutions depending ModelSamplingFlux

- **BasicSchedulerNormalized**  
  A scheduler node with built-in denoise  normalization to ensure stable consistent sampling results across schedulers.

- **LogSigmaSamplerNode** & **LogSigmaStepSamplerNode**
  These nodes offer direct access to the internal model noise curve‚Äîthe curve the model expects from sigma values during diffusion.
  LogSigmaSamplerNode enables manipulation of this curve directly, allowing users to enhance fine details, introduce natural imperfections, or soften the final image by shifting how the model interprets noise over time.
  This approach gives precise control over the model's behavior‚Äîsimilar in effect to techniques used by Detail Deamon or Lying Sigmas.
  These nodes are ideal for users looking to experiment with or customize the core diffusion response for artistic or technical purposes.
  
- **TBG_Preview_Sender_WebSocket**
  This node lets you send images directly from memory to memory, right through ComfyUI‚Äôs websocket no need to save anything to disk. Just plug it in as an output for your images, and you can instantly fetch the previews      from another web interface or app connected to your ComfyUI websocket.
